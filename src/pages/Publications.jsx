The issue was investigated from three viewpoints. Is there any impact of non-corpus-based stopword removal on chosen Indian languages (if yes, to what extent)? Can we recommend, based on experiment, a number of stopwords for chosen Indian languages that are good enough from retrieval point of view? Is there any relationship of stopwords with average document length from retrieval perspective? It is observed that the stopword removal generally improves mean average precision (MAP) significantly compared with the case when it is not done. For each language, different lengths of the stopword list are explored and evaluated that lead to suggesting its optimal length. We also study the effect of stopwords on retrieval performance over document length. The effect of stopwords is generally found to be quite low in short documents compared with their long counterparts across the four Indian languages.},\nissn={0973-7677},\ndoi={10.1007/s12046-021-01731-z},\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1007/s12046-021-01731-z}\n}",

Research papers and proposals are reviewed by several peers before they are finally accepted or rejected for publication and funding, respectively. With the steady increase in the number of research domains, scholarly venues (journal and/or conference), researchers, and papers, managing the peer review process is becoming a daunting task. Application of recommender systems to assist peer reviewing is, therefore, being explored and becoming an emerging research area. In this paper, we present a deep learning network based Meta-Review Generation considering peer review prediction of the scholarly article (MRGen). MRGen is able to provide solutions for: (i) Peer review prediction (Task 1) and (ii) Meta-review generation (Task 2). First, the system takes the peer reviews as input and produces a draft meta-review. Then it employs an integrated framework of convolution layer, long short-term memory (LSTM) model, Bi-LSTM model, and attention mechanism to predict the final decision (accept/reject) of the scholarly article. Based on the final decision, the proposed model MRGen incorporates Pointer Generator Network-based abstractive summarization to generate the final meta-review. The focus of our approach is to give a concise meta-review that maximizes information coverage, coherence, readability and also reduces redundancy. Extensive experiments conducted on the PeerRead dataset demonstrate good consistency between the recommended decisions and original decisions. We also compare the performance of MRGen with some of the existing state-of-the-art multi-document summarization methods. The system also outperforms a few existing models based on accuracy, Rouge scores, readability, non-redundancy, and cohesion.}\n}",

First, we try to see the effect of occurrence of emergencies on social media. Second, when there is a sudden surge of posts in social media due to the occurrence, how that deluge of data can be effectively extracted and processed to create situational awareness and minimize the damage due to the disaster. Third, how different social media posts can help different government and other agencies to get prepared and to take necessary steps to manage emergencies in order to minimize the loss.
